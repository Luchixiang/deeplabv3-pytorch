## train the backbon with cityscape dataset
1. download the dataset
2. use utils.preprocess.py to preprocess the dataset
3. train the model with train.py
4. evalute on single image with evalute.py

## train the final model with an additional conv layer and my own dataset
1. preprocess my dataset with data_spilt
2. use the model RNnet.py
3.retrain the model
